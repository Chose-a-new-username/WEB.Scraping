You are an asylum patient and you have just survived a car crash – the problem is you can't remember anything. Visions reveal answers to some questions, but create even more riddles! Which part of it is true? What do all these things mean?  \n>  \n>Sanitarium is one of the few psychological horror adventure games. As the protagonist you will visit five different worlds full of riddles and answers, with which you will have to figure out what exactly is happening and what is real. The story is so incredibly good and enthralling that it could easily drive a sane person mad.",1654528066,t3_v65h34,/r/Freegamestuff/comments/v65h34/gog_game_sanitarium_1998/ibdgvre/

They don't make an appearance in New Colossus afair. \n\nTL;DR; If you only plan to play New Order, pick Fergus. If you plan to play the sequel too, consider picking Wyatt (or pick Wyatt in a second playthrough of 1 before starting New Colossus).",1654793253,t1_iay0y6m,/r/Freegamestuff/comments/v3atpc/epic_games_game_wolfenstein_the_new_order/ibr0w73/
